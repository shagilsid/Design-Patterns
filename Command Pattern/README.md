# Command Pattern
Command Pattern is like a remote control where buttons can be modified to take different commands, and those remote buttons perform the desired actions.

## Advantages


- Makes our code extensible as we can add new commands without changing existing code.

- Reduces coupling the invoker and receiver of a command.


## Disadvantages:
- Increase in the number of classes for each individual command
